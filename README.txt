The program that I wrote is a program that runs to simulate the results of a freestyle skiing competition. To do this, I created an constructor object as a template to create the skiers with. I gave each skier a name and an ability level. I then created a function to return their ability * a Math.random() which represents their performance on that particular run. Finally I added in three skiers - Eric, Candide, and Tanner. To create this I used the class material and some help from my TA.
